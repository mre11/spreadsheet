In GetCellValue, I forgot to convert the cell name parameter to upper-case so that both lower- and upper-case inputs are allowed.  My test cases should have caught this mistake, but they did not test for this error.
With this change, I pass the following previously-failed tests:
Formula1
Formula2
Formula3
Formula4
Formula4a
Formula4b
LongTestWithTimeout12
LongTestWithTimeout15
LongTestWithTimeout3
LongTestWithTimeout6
LongTestWithTimeout9
