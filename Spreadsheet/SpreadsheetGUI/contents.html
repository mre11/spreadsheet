    <h1>How To Use Spreadsheet</h1>
    <h2>Editing the spreadsheet</h2>
    <p>
        You can select a cell for editing by clicking on it in the main window.  The name
        and value of the selected cell are displayed near the top of the window.  Once selected,
        you can edit the cell's formula by typing in the Formula box and clicking Set or pressing
        Enter.  If entering a cell reference or other calculation, the first character should be
        "=".
    </p>    
    <h2>Using the file menu</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>New</b> menu item opens an empty spreadsheet in a new window.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Open</b> menu item allows you to open an existing Spreadsheet (.ss) file. The selected
        file is opened in a new window.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Save</b> menu item saves the file to the current file path.  If the file has not yet been
        saved, you will be prompted to choose a file name and location.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Save As</b> menu item allows you to save the current file to a new name and/or location.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Close</b> menu item closes the current window.  The application will not be exited until
        all windows are closed.
